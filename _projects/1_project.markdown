title: Learning Distributional Programs for Relational Autocompletion
description: Relational autocompletion is the problem of automatically predicting missing values in a relational database. To address this problem, we introduce LyRic, a novel approach based on probabilistic programming, and in particular on the distributional clauses framework, which extends logic programming with discrete and continuous probability distributions. LyRic learns both the structure and parameters of a distributional program that specifies a probability distribution over the entire database, in the presence of missing values. In contrast with standard approaches to missing value imputation, LyRic is designed to deal with multiple related tables. In addition, it natively handles discrete and continuous values and can make use of additional background knowledge, if available. Computing the best autocompletion, in the relational setting, can often become infeasible in practice. To address this issue, we also propose an approximate autocompletion approach. Our empirical results show that our approach achieves good performance, even when a large portion of the database is missing.
